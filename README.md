## ⚡ My Work
These are a few of my strongest and favorite projects. Check out my pinned projects below for additional work samples. 

### Crowdfunding Excel Cleaning and Analysis
[Project Respository](https://github.com/hmk81996/excel-challenge)
- Tools: Excel
- Cleaned and analyzed a database. Created pivot tables and charts to uncover trends.

### Employee Database
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/sql-challenge)
- Tools: SQL, PostgreSQL, QuickDBD
- Using six CSV files, designed corresponding tables, imported those files into a SQL database, and performed a series of queries on this new database.

### Citi Bike Dashboard
[Tableau Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hannah.miles.kingrey/viz/citibike_analysis_17392480645700/Story1)

[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/citibike-dashboard)
- Tools: Tableau, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas
- Concatenated and cleaned quarterly data from Citi Bike to create a new CSV file to visualize using Tableau. Includes three dashboards and an interactive map.

### Biodiversity Dataset
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/javascript-visualization-challenge)
- Tools: Javascript, D3.js, HTML, CSS
- Using a Belly Button Biodviersity dataset (which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels), build an interactive dashboard that 1) displays a panel of demographic data for each subject and updates for user selections 2) creates a bubble chart and a bar chart for each user selected subject.

### Weather Variables and Ideal Vacation Locations
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/python-api-challenge/tree/main)
- Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, scipy), Jupyter Notebook, OpenWeatherMap and GeoApify APIs
- Using OpenWeatherMap, I generated a series of plots showing latitude in relation to weather variables for a dataset of global cities. Using this same dataset, I filtered for "ideal weather conditions" and used GeoApify to find hotels within range of those ideal vacation spots.
