### Weather Variables and Ideal Vacation Locations
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/python-api-challenge/tree/main)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python (pandas, numpy, scipy), OpenWeatherMap and GeoApify APIs
- Using OpenWeatherMap, I generated a series of plots showing latitude in relation to weather variables for a dataset of global cities. Using this same dataset, I filtered for "ideal weather conditions" and used GeoApify to find hotels within range of those ideal vacation spots.
