## âš¡ My Work
These are a few of my strongest and favorite projects. Check out my pinned projects below for additional work samples. 

### Weather Variables and Ideal Vacation Locations
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/python-api-challenge/tree/main)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python (pandas, numpy, scipy), OpenWeatherMap and GeoApify APIs
- Using OpenWeatherMap, I generated a series of plots showing latitude in relation to weather variables for a dataset of global cities. Using this same dataset, I filtered for "ideal weather conditions" and used GeoApify to find hotels within range of those ideal vacation spots.

### Employee Database
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/sql-challenge)
- Tools: SQL, PostgreSQL, QuickDBD
- Using six CSV files, I designed corresponding tables, imported those files into a SQL database, and performed a series of queries on this new database.

### Climate Analysis
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/sqlalchemy-challenge/tree/main)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python, SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask API
- Using a couple of databases containing weather station data, I retreived and plotted the 12 most recent months of precipitation data. Next, I found the weather station with the greatest number of observations and plotted the 12 most recent months of temperature data.
