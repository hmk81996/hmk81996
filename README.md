### Biodiversity Dataset
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/javascript-visualization-challenge)
- Tools: Javascript, D3.js, HTML, CSS
- Using a Belly Button Biodviersity dataset (which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels), build an interactive dashboard that 1) displays a panel of demographic data for each subject and updates for user selections 2) creates a bubble chart and a bar chart for each user selected subject.

### Weather Variables and Ideal Vacation Locations
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hmk81996/python-api-challenge/tree/main)
- Tools: Python (pandas, numpy, scipy), Jupyter Notebook, OpenWeatherMap and GeoApify APIs
